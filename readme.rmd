# Practical-Machine-Learning_Course-Project

## Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.
In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Data

## Prediction Feature Extraction
In this project, the outcome of the prediction model is the classification of the way that the barbell lift is performed based on the sensor measurements. The model outcome is represented in the 'class' variable in the training set which has 5 levels including "A","B","C","D", and "E". For model feature extraction, only raw sensor measurements (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings) from belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell at Euler angles (roll, pitch, and yaw) are used, omitting summary statistics variables. Below keywards are used for feature extraction: "^roll", "^pitch", "^yaw", "^accel", "^gyros", "^magnet" and "^total". Using this approach, 52 predictors varaibles can be extracted from training set.

  predictorIdx <- c(grep("^roll", names(training)), grep("^pitch", names(training)), grep("^yaw", names(training)), grep("^accel", names(training)), grep("^gyros", names(training)), grep("^magnet", names(training)), grep("^total", names(training)))

    makeVector <- function(x = numeric()) {
            m <- NULL
            set <- function(y) {
                    x <<- y
                    m <<- NULL
            }
            get <- function() x
            setmean <- function(mean) m <<- mean
            getmean <- function() m
            list(set = set, get = get,
                 setmean = setmean,
                 getmean = getmean)
    }

The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector"
created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the
mean has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the mean from the
cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the mean of
the data and sets the value of the mean in the cache via the `setmean`
function.

    cachemean <- function(x, ...) {
            m <- x$getmean()
            if(!is.null(m)) {
                    message("getting cached data")
                    return(m)
            }
            data <- x$get()
            m <- mean(data, ...)
            x$setmean(m)
            m
    }
