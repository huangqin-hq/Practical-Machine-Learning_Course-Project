# Practical-Machine-Learning_Course-Project

## Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.\
In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Data
The training data for this project are available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

```{r}
library(caret)
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
```

## Prediction Feature Extraction
In this project, the outcome of the prediction model is the classification of the way that the barbell lift is performed based on the sensor measurements. The model outcome is represented in the 'class' variable in the training set which has 5 levels including "A","B","C","D", and "E".\
For model feature extraction, only raw sensor measurements (accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings) from belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell at Euler angles (roll, pitch, and yaw) are used, omitting summary statistics variables. Below keywards are used for feature extraction: "^roll", "^pitch", "^yaw", "^accel", "^gyros", "^magnet" and "^total". Using this approach, 52 predictors varaibles can be extracted from training set.

```{r}
predictorIdx <- c(grep("^roll", names(training)), grep("^pitch", names(training)), grep("^yaw", names(training)), grep("^accel", names(training)), grep("^gyros", names(training)), grep("^magnet", names(training)), grep("^total", names(training)))
```

## Training Data Set and Cross-Validation
10-fold cross-validation algorithm is used to imporove the model performance. The training data set is further partitioned into a cv training set(80%) which is used to train the prediction model, and a cv test set(20%) which could be used to validate the accuracy of the prediction model.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y = trainPredSet$classe, p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
cvTrain <- trainPredSet[inTrain, ]
cvTest <- trainPredSet[-inTrain, ]
fitCtrl <- trainControl(method = "repeatedcv", number = 10, repeats = 10)
```

## Prediction Model Selection
In view of the large number of predictors and large training data set, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis is used to generate reasonalbly good accuracy within reasonalbly short processing time.
```{r}
modFit <- train(classe ~ ., data = cvTrain, method = "qda", trControl = fitCtrl)
```

## Expected Out-of-Sample Error
By applying the cross-validationg training set into the model, accuracy is 90.0%. Thus, the expected out-of-sample error is more than 10.0% as typically the prediction model achieves less accuracy on new data sets.

predTrain <- predict(modFit, newdata = cvTrain)
equalPredTrain <- (predTrain == cvTrain$classe)
print(sum(equalPredTrain)/length(equalPredTrain))

## Summary
In this project, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis with cross-validation is used to build predicton models to classify the way that the barbell lift is performed based on the sensor measurements. Only raw sensor measurements are used as predciiton features while summary statistics of these raw measurements are omitted. The prediciton model can achieve a high classification accuracy of ~90% based on the results of cross-validation test set which is not used to train the model. The model is then applied to 20 test cases available in the test data set to predict their barbell lift behaviour.
